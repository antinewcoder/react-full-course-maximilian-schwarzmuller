# React Full Course Maximilian Schwarzmuller

ðŸ“š About This Repo

This repository documents my progress as I complete Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼llerâ€™s React â€“ The Complete Guide Course. I keep track of challenges and mini-projects built along the way.


The course covers the full modern React ecosystem:
	â€¢	Components, props, state, events
	â€¢	Hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef, useReducer, custom hooks)
	â€¢	React Router & Navigation
	â€¢	State management with Context API & Redux
	â€¢	Side effects, HTTP requests, Async operations
	â€¢	Performance optimization & deployment

ðŸš€ Goal

By the end of the course, I want to build production-ready React apps, and integrate React with backend services to build full-stack applications
